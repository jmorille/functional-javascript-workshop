--- Exercice of Functional Javascript
http://nodeschool.io/#functionaljs

Once you have node installed, open cmd.exe or Terminal.app and run:
npm install -g functional-javascript-workshop@latest

(Mac/Linux users: if that doesn't work try it again with 'sudo' in front). Now you have a functional-javascript-workshop command. 

Just run:
functional-javascript-workshop
